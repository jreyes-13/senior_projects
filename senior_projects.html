    <h1 class="display-4">General Information</h1>

    <p class="lead my-3">The goal of the capstone project is to put into practice what you have learned and demonstrate the ability 
      to expand your knowledge and skills. It should be taken in your last semester, possibly the semester before that if you are
      coordinating with other teammates.
    </p>

    <p class="lead my-3">The first step is to register for <span class="font-weight-bold">CSCI 4390 Senior Project </span>. Multiple sections are offered under different faculty members. While the faculty member listed is the instructor of record, theyâ€™re <span class="font-italic">not</span> the main contact person or the one who manages the different aspects of the course.     
    </p>

    <p class="lead my-3">
      Who will supervise my senior project?
      A <span class="font-italic">faculty adviser</span> will guide your project. Advisers can be any faculty member from our department, and students usually begin looking for one after forming a team and deciding on a project idea.
      If you would prefer to meet and work in Brownsville, sign up for the Brownsville section. That doesn't commit you, but helps with organization.
    </p>

    <p class="lead my-3">Will I work on a senior project on my own? Typically, no. The course objectives emphasize a comprehensive software development experience, which typically involves collaboration among multiple team members. The exception applies to students pursuing individual research projects or those already working under the supervision of a research advisor.
    </p>

    <p class="lead my-3">
      What kind of project is accesptable as a senior project? By design, you have a lot of freedom to propose a project idea to your adviser. Your faculty adviser is there to help you scope something reasonable, guide you to stay on track, and evaluate your effectiveness in executing the project.</p>

    <p class="lead my-3">What is the scope of a senior project? The project provides experience working with a team to plan, manage, and deliver a project that is more
      substantial than what you get do in classes. You will also practice presenting your work.</p>

    
    <p class="lead my-3 font-italic">Wait, do I have to attend class at that time? Read on...</p>

    <h1 class="display-4">The Details</h1>

    <ul class="lead my-3">

      <li>Every project must be a team of 2-4 students</li>
      <li>Every project must have a faculty adviser
        <ul>
          <li>The details of the project are up to you and your adviser to agree on</li>
          <li>The faculty adviser will typically meet with you weekly and provide guidance to help you stay on track</li>
          <li>The faculty adviser does <span class="font-weight-bold">not</span> have to be an expert on the specific technology
            you work with (that's your job)</li>
        </ul>
      </li><li>Required deliverables for all projects
        <ul>
          <li>Proposal </li>
          <li>Midterm milestone: poster and live demo</li>
          <li>Final poster presentation </li>
          <li>Final written report</li>  
          <li>Final oral presentation</li> 
          <li>Final product</li> 

          </ul>

        </ul>
      </li><li>Types of projects
        <ul>
          <li>Most projects will design, mockup, develop, and test a software product
            <ul>
              <li>May include hardware integration</li>
              <li>May extend an existing or ongoing project</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Other projects will hypothesize, design, and run computational experiments</li>
          <li class="font-italic">Any project that a faculty adviser approves is acceptable</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You can form teams with students from other CECS programs. It will be up to you as a team to ensure that you fulfill
        the requirements each program has for their students.</li>
      <li>You can form teams across campuses, as long as the team and adviser are on the same page. Many projects continue to
        use online meetings.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h1 class="display-4">Getting Organized</h1>    

    <p class="lead my-3">We <span class="font-weight-bold">strongly</span> recommend that you prepare for your project before the
      semester. Design work and setting up unfamiliar technologies are things that can easily stall out progress. It's
      much more relaxed, enjoyable, and effective to kick around ideas, explore new things, and hammer out details when the clock isn't running.
    </p>

    <p class="lead mt-3">To that end, we have two preferred options for settling on your team, project, and adviser. It doesn't always
      work out that way, so we also have a backup plan.
    </p>

    <div class="p-4 p-md-5 text-white rounded bg-dark">
      <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Option 1A: Self-Organization</h1>
      <ul class="lead my-3">
        <!-- <li>Browse the list of <a href="faculty_interests.pdf">faculty interests</a> - it may give you broad ideas, or help you know who you'd like to talk to</li> -->
        <li>Form a team of 2-4 students</li>
        <li>Fill out a <a href="Proposal Template_Revised.docx">1-page initial proposal</a> on your own idea</li>
        <li>Meet with faculty members to discuss your project idea</li>
        <li>(Check the Faculty-Defined Projects below to see examples of what faculty work on)</li>
        <li>Once a faculty member agrees to advise your project, you are set!</li>
        <li>Coordinate with your adviser and hit the ground running at the start of the semester</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead my-3 font-italic">Self-organizing gives you the most say in who you work with and what you work on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 p-md-5 mt-4 text-white rounded bg-dark">
      <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Option 1B: Faculty Projects</h1>
      <ul class="lead my-3">
        <!-- <li>Look at the list of <a href="https://faculty.utrgv.edu/emmett.tomai/admin/202410_faculty_projects.pdf">Faculty-Defined Projects</a></li> -->
        <li>These are project ideas that faculty are interested in advising students on</li>
        <li>Some are more specific, some more general</li>
        <li>More specific projects may be okay with individuals joining separately to form a team</li>
        <li>Interested? Contact the faculty to discuss</li>
        <li>Coordinate with your adviser and hit the ground running at the start of the semester</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead my-3 font-italic">If there is a particular faculty member you really want to work with, this is the simplest way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-4 p-md-5 mt-4 text-white rounded bg-dark">
      <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Back-up Plan: Start of Class</h1>
      <ul class="lead my-3">
        <li>Students who do not have a team, project, and adviser will attend the class for the first two weeks</li>
        <li>Class meetings will be in-person, at the scheduled time, on each campus</li>
        <li>For those two weeks, students will form teams, propose projects, and be assigned an adviser</li>
        <li>At the end of those two weeks, you work with your team and adviser going forward</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead my-3 font-italic">Not the optimal way to get started, try to get going before this.</p>
